Trackr Android App
==================

**Note**: Trackr uses version 7 of Gradle, which currently requires Android Studio Beta or Canary.

Trackr is a sample task management app used to explore common UI patterns
from the perspective of supporting accessibility. Trackr is currently under
development.

Using Trackr, end users can discover, create, and edit tasks; they can
assign tasks to team members and they can associate different tags with
each task.  Users can archive a task by swiping right and they can modify a
task's priority by dragging it up or down.

Developers are encouraged to explore Trackr using an accessibility service
like [Talkback](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6283677?hl=en) or
[Switch Access](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6122836?hl=en);
developers are also encouraged to try out the various accessibility settings
found on their devices (see Settings > Accessibility on most Android phones)
when using Trackr. If you have any suggestions, please create an issue
(see below).

Trackr is designed with the goal of allowing all users to enjoy its core
functionality, including users with disabilities who may interact with their
devices using accessibility services. So, for example, while blind and low
vision users or users with manual dexterity issues may not be able to perform
the swipe gesture to archive an item or drag and drop items to reorder their
priority, they should nonetheless be able to access the archive and reorder
functionality through the accessibility service they are using.
